    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This how-to steam shrimp recipe results in perfectly steamed shrimp you can add to any pasta dish, or feel free to serve chilled with cocktail sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound fresh shrimp</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Set a steamer basket into a heavy saucepan and pour in enough water, so the steamer basket sits just on top of the water without touching it. Remove steamer basket and bring water to a boil.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, butterfly the shrimp with a sharp paring knife, carefully running the knife 1 inch down the bottom of the shrimp without cutting all the way through. Press shrimp open.</li>
      <li>Set shrimp into the steamer basket and sprinkle with salt. Set steamer basket over the boiling water (shrimp should not touch the water).</li>
      <li>Steam shrimp until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, carefully moving shrimp around using tongues so they cook evenly, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately or chill for later use.</li>
    </ol>
